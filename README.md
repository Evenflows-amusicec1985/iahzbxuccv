Man, just finished watching Antes del cuerpo and I'm like... what the heck just happened? 😂 I swear, I went into it all chill, thinking I'd be in for some low-key, artsy vibes. But NOPE! My brain was doing cartwheels. I mean, seriously, talk about twisting your story into twelve different knots, right? The whole time I was just trying to figure out what’s real, what’s... ya know, movie magic or whatever. 

I kinda feel like I need to download the movie and watch it again, just to pick up on all the stuff I missed. Trust me, it's one of those films where you blink and whoosh—you're suddenly lost! Also, what was up with that soundtrack? Like, all calm and relaxing, but the stuff on screen is chaos, man. Like, hello? Emotional rollercoaster much?

> And the actors, oh, my god, they were on fire. I mean, is it even fair to be that good? Makes you want to quit your day job and just... run away to Hollywood or something, haha! But seriously, at one point, you're sitting there rooting for the main guy, and then boom, plot twist and you're questioning all your life choices just like he was! 😅 It's wild, honestly.

And the director must’ve had a field day with those scenes. I mean, the angles, the colors, it’s like each scene had its own mood board or whatever. Must’ve been some kinda process. But you know what I mean? It's like they went let's screw with the audience, just for funsies.

print(Why did I even code this line?)  # Lol, lost in my thoughts, don't mind me 🤷‍♂️

Anyway, I think you’d love it. You should totally watch the movie when you get a chance. You'll get what I mean about the head-spinning plots. And afterwards, you can tell me if I’m just losing it or if it really was that intense, lol. Definitely worth a watch, even if it fries your brain a bit. 😂
